<h2>Can I too make a led matrix like this one?</h2>
Of course! A detailed project description ~~is coming soon on Hackster.io~~ is live on [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/salwaElkaddaoui/bluetooth-controlled-led-matrix-894614). You'll learn about the nuts and bolts of the project, including all the design choices I made along the way.
